## 👋 Hey there, I'm Rafly 👋
![Hello](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExMXk3dzQ2dDdzZ3Vhd3VmcDExYWxhcmJua2E1bG81aWFhdXQzeDQybyZlcD12MV9naWZzX3NlYXJjaCZjdD1n/AFdcYElkoNAUE/giphy.gif)

I'm semester 2 student at **Bina Sarana Informatika University (BSI)** with a growing passion for programming and software development.  
I enjoy building projects using **Python** and **Java**, and I'm always open to learning new technologies.

I take pride in being a strong **team player**, someone who communicates well and contributes actively to group projects.  
Right now, I'm focused on sharpening my skills and building a solid portfolio through both personal and collaborative work.
